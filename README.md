# Sudoku Solver

This is a simple console application written in C++ to solve Sudoku puzzles.

# Description:
The program uses a backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles. 
It takes a predefined Sudoku board as input and recursively attempts to fill in the missing cells. 
If a valid solution is found, it displays the solved Sudoku board.

# Usage:
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. The program will display the initial Sudoku board.
4. It will then attempt to solve the Sudoku puzzle.
5. If a solution is found, the solved Sudoku board will be displayed.

# Sudoku Board Representation:
The Sudoku board is represented as a 9x9 integer array. The value 0 represents an empty cell, and numbers from 1 to 9 represent filled cells.
